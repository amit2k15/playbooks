Subject: Resolution and Mitigation Steps for Recent Zabbix Proxy Issue

Dear Abhishek,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with a detailed update regarding the recent issue we encountered with the Zabbix proxy.

The gaps in the graph were caused by the binlog being full, which resulted in the Zabbix proxy being unable to sync data with the central server. Simultaneously, the Zabbix agent was not running on the server due to an ownership issue with the Zabbix log directory. Consequently, we did not receive an alert when the log directory reached 80% capacity.

To address this, I have thoroughly investigated and resolved the ownership issue in our remaining proxies. I am currently double-checking all proxies to ensure there are no lingering ownership issues that could lead to similar problems in the future.

This incident is not isolated; we have encountered similar situations in the past due to various factors:

1. Monthly server patching sometimes results in extended server downtime, causing delays in the Zabbix proxy startup. We have implemented measures to manually start the Zabbix proxy in such scenarios to minimize disruptions.

2. MySQL occasionally experiences high resource utilization, leading to system hangs. To mitigate this, we have increased system resources to ensure smooth operation.

3. Previous incidents were also triggered by planned activities on the Zabbix production instance. We have since reviewed and refined our processes to prevent recurrence.

Rest assured, we are actively monitoring the Zabbix proxy and implementing measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Your understanding and cooperation are greatly appreciated as we work to ensure the stability and reliability of our systems.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
