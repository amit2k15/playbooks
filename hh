Subject: Password Expiry Details for monuser IDs

Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. 

I have recently discussed with our secure team regarding the feasibility of fetching password expiry details for monuser IDs through an API or portal. Unfortunately, due to security reasons, we are unable to provide password details of any account through external means. This policy ensures that only the owners of their respective accounts have the authority to securely check their passwords.

At present, there is no portal or API available for accessing password expiry information externally. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
