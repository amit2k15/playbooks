Hi Abhishek,

Thanks for your interest in our internal Zabbix server monitoring setup!

I'm glad to provide an update on the recent changes we've implemented:

1. Cross-functional Monitoring:

We've now enabled cross-functional monitoring for our internal servers. This means that our monitoring covers various aspects of server health, ensuring comprehensive oversight.

2. Zabbix Internal Server Monitoring in ORX Elasticsearch Platform:

We've successfully integrated our Zabbix internal servers with the ORX Elasticsearch platform. This allows us to leverage the platform's powerful search and analytics capabilities for even deeper insights into server performance.

3. OpenTelemetry Agent and Enterprise Grafana Integration:

By default, each server is equipped with the OpenTelemetry agent. This agent collects monitoring metrics and feeds them into Enterprise Grafana through InfluxDB. This provides a centralized and user-friendly interface for visualizing server health data.

4. Splunk Integration (Pilot):

We've initiated a pilot program to integrate a few servers with Splunk. The plan is to gradually add all remaining servers to Splunk for even more robust monitoring capabilities.

We're confident that these enhancements will significantly improve our internal server monitoring and provide us with valuable data to optimize server performance and proactively identify potential issues.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or require additional details.

Thanks,
