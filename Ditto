Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

Thank you for attending the recent meeting on implementing self-healing for the services on servers A and B. Below is a summary of the key points discussed and the action items identified:

Meeting Points Discussed:
Overview of Self-Healing Using Zabbix:

We reviewed how the self-healing mechanism works within the Zabbix monitoring system.
Current Alerting Mechanism:

Discussed the existing alerting configuration: Zabbix is set to a 1-minute polling interval to check service status. An alert is triggered when the service state changes to any state other than "Running."
Alert Condition for Self-Healing:

We examined the need to adjust the alert conditions to properly trigger a self-healing job. In certain cases, services may enter a "Stop pending" state before reaching a fully "Stopped" state, which can take a few seconds to minutes. To address this, Zabbix will initiate the self-heal action after three consecutive polling failures (any state other than "Running" for three consecutive intervals). To optimize this process, we need to modify the alerting condition.
Implementation Plan:

Discussed the steps to implement self-healing in both non-production and production environments.
Action Items:
Working Session with Windows Team:

Schedule a working session with the Windows team to modify the Zabbix agent configuration for self-healing in the lower environment.
Testing in Non-Prod Environment:

Test the self-healing setup in the non-production environment by deliberately stopping a service to ensure the configuration works as expected.
Please let me know if any additional points need to be addressed or if you have any questions regarding the action items.

Looking forward to the next steps.
