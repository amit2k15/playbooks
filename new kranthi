Hi Kranthi,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to touch base regarding our ongoing project to upgrade Zabbix from version 5.0 to 6.0, as well as the ProxySQL upgrade from PXC MySQL setup. As you are aware, we had to pause our efforts due to the peak season demands on our resources.

Now that the peak season has concluded, I believe it's an opportune time to reignite our efforts and push forward with the project. Your expertise and collaboration are crucial to ensure the smooth and timely completion of this upgrade.

Could we schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss the project in detail? I'd like to review our current progress, any challenges we may face, and establish a plan to move forward efficiently.

Please let me know your availability, and I'll coordinate a meeting time that works for both of us.

Thank you for your continued support and collaboration.
