Hi Rajesh,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that we temporarily disabled the email action on our Zabbix server due to our monthly patching schedule. This was necessary to ensure the smooth and secure operation of our systems.

Rest assured, the email action will be re-enabled shortly, and you can expect to receive notifications as usual once the patching process is complete.

If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
