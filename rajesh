I had a detailed discussion with Neha from the storage team. She mentioned that they use a specialized tool called the storage array to monitor the performance of the storage device, along with connected backend devices such as hypervisors and VMs. They conduct daily health checks using this tool.

Neha informed me that they observed high utilization specifically on our MySQL server. This situation could potentially impact other applications since they are connected to the same storage device. That's why they reached out to us to address this concern.

Unfortunately, Neha mentioned that they cannot provide access to the storage array tool to other teams. It's exclusively utilized by the storage team for monitoring purposes.
