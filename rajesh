Dear Courtney,

I hope this email finds you well. Please find attached the custom scripts status report for both tpau2prod and tpau2dolprod servers, including the alert severity and monitoring intervals that we are currently monitoring in Zabbix.

Regarding the tpau2dol server, I have conducted a cross-verification. Unfortunately, I noticed that communication is no longer happening from any of our Zabbix proxies on port 22. This is impacting our ability to monitor the appmgr account authentication and execute the custom scripts effectively.

To enable monitoring and proceed further, we need to allow communication through the firewall. Could you please assist in making the necessary adjustments to allow communication on port 22 for our Zabbix proxies?

To enable monitoring and ensure seamless functionality, we will need to allow communication in the firewall. Kindly let me know the next steps or any further information required from my end to proceed with resolving this issue.
Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your cooperation.
