Hi Courtney,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for bringing the incident INC34863168 related to Zabbix disk read/write requests on the Dol and TPAU2PROD servers to my attention.

Upon thorough investigation, I have identified the root cause of the issue. It appears that there was a lag in monitoring data syncing in the Zabbix database during the period from 12/17 to 12/18. This lag resulted in the reported disk read/write problems.

Rest assured, we are taking proactive steps to ensure the stability and reliability of our monitoring system.We understand the criticality of reliable monitoring for our servers, and we are committed to ensuring the stability and performance of our systems.

Thank you for your understanding.
