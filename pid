Dear Courtney,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the incident INC34863168 related to disk read/write latency for the DOL and TPAU2PROD servers in Zabbix.

After conducting a thorough investigation, I have verified the monitoring data for both servers during the period from 8 pm on 12/17 to 4 pm on 12/18. It was observed that there was a spike in read/write requests that exceeded the threshold of 20 ms set in Zabbix. As a result, alerts were triggered by Zabbix.

Our established threshold for read/write latency in Zabbix is 15 ms. However, during the mentioned timeframe, the latency surpassed this threshold, leading to the triggered alerts. I would like to highlight that once the latency returned to normal values, the alerts were automatically cleared by the system.

It's important to note that this issue was specific to the DOL and TPAU2PROD servers, as we did not observe similar latency-related issues for other servers during the same period.

If you have any further questions or if there is anything else you would like me to investigate, please feel free to let me know.

Thank you for your understanding.
