Hi Kranthi/Edith,

I am writing to bring to your attention some concerns we have encountered following the recent upgrade of our Zabbix stage instance to MySQL version 8.0.32 from 8.0.29.

Upon completing the upgrade, we have observed abnormal behavior that is manifesting in various issues, which are quite unusual. This is causing disruptions and hampers the normal functioning of our system.

I would like to schedule a call to discuss on the same in details. Your insights and expertise will be invaluable in resolving these matters swiftly.

could you please let us know your availability to discuss this matter in details. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, and I look forward to working together to address and resolve these challenges.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to submit my shift allowances for October and November on time. Consequently, I submitted all three months' allowances in December, logging a total of 49 days: October (14 days), November (15 days), and December (20 days).

Based on my calculations, the total allowance for these 49 days should amount to 26,950. However, upon receiving my January compensation, I noticed that I was only credited with 15,000, which seems to be significantly lower than the expected amount.
