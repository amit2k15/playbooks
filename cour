Hi Mona,

The monitoring setup which we have recently implemented for IFMS probes is indeed quite similar to what we have configured for other URLs and web services in Zabbix. However, I would like to highlight distinct enhancement that we've recently incorporated.

Zabbix, by default, does not support Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for monitoring URLs or Web services for full synthetic monitoring features. Recognizing the importance of this functionality, we have taken the initiative to integrate a new module into Zabbix, which we refer to as Synthetic Monitoring.

This module is specifically designed to seamlessly authenticate SSO-based applications, providing a comprehensive out-of-the-box solution for synthetic monitoring. we can now extend our monitoring capabilities to cover more funcitionalities based on the scenarios or requierments.

If you have any further questions or if there's anything specific you would like to explore regarding this new Synthetic Monitoring module, please feel free to reach our team.
