Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the status of the Zabbix probes and the Synthetic Monitoring POC.

Upon cross-verifying the probes in Orx-Zabbix, I identified that we are currently utilizing the "zabbix_ogs" non-user account to monitor the probes. However, we recently received new probes from Mona/Team for enabling synthetic monitoring, similar to Enterprise Zabbix APM, as part of a Proof of Concept (POC). For this POC, we are using the user account "rxwebmonprod."

During our testing, we encountered a login failure issue with the "rxwebmonprod" account, and upon further investigation, we discovered that the password had expired. We have already communicated this to the application team, and they are addressing the password expiration issue.

It's important to note that, since this is a new request for the POC, we have not yet integrated alerting with Interlink. Consequently, you may not find any information related to alerting on the Interlink dashboard at this time.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work through these issues to ensure the success of the Synthetic Monitoring POC. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your cooperation.
