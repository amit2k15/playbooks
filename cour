Dear [Insurance Company Representative's Name],

I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that, as per your suggestion, I have submitted the claim for refurbishment in the portal. This is in reference to Claim ID: [Your Claim ID]. As previously discussed, the total amount incurred for the hospitalization and treatment of my mother was $268,000. The initial approval from the insurance company was for $100,000, leaving a balance of $168,000, which I settled personally to facilitate the discharge of my mother from the hospital.

I have attached all the necessary documents to support my claim in both the portal and this email. Kindly review the new claim submission and the attached documents. If there are any additional documents required or if you need further clarification on any aspect of the claim, please do not hesitate to let me know.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and kindly request you to process the claim at the earliest convenience. Your assistance in expediting this process is crucial, considering the circumstances.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I look forward to a swift resolution.
