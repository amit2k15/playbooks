Dear Courtney,

I trust this email finds you well. We appreciate your attention to our file presence monitoring system.

I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully enabled the basic file presence monitoring, providing an overall count of files exceeding 24 hours. However, in order to enhance our monitoring capabilities and provide detailed information, we need to make some adjustments to the Zabbix agent configuration file.

To achieve this, we propose scheduling a working session where we can collaborate and modify the configuration to enable the tracking of specific file names that exceed the 24-hour threshold.

Your expertise is crucial to ensuring the successful implementation of these changes, and we value your input during this process. Please let us know your availability for a working session at your earliest convenience. We aim to schedule a time that is convenient for you and ensures a smooth collaboration.

Your cooperation in this matter is highly appreciated, and we look forward to working together to validate the configured parameters.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
