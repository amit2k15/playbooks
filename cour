Hi Mona,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for bringing the recent performance issue to my attention. I have conducted a thorough cross-verification and identified that the problem seems to be specific to this particular database, occurring consistently only during the weekends.

Upon reviewing our past experiences, a similar issue arose with one of the Oracle databases supporting a different application. In that instance, we traced the problem back to user access settings. To ensure we are not encountering a similar situation here, I kindly request you to double-check the user through which the DBA team monitors this database.

Additionally, considering the time-specific nature of the issue (weekends), there might be a possibility that other jobs running during this period are contributing to the problem. I recommend investigating any scheduled tasks or automated processes that might coincide with the reported performance degradation.

Your collaboration in examining these aspects will greatly assist in pinpointing the root cause and devising an effective resolution. Please feel free to reach out if you require further details or if there's any additional information that could aid in our investigation.

Looking forward to resolving this issue promptly.
