Subject: Update on Zabbix Proxy Migration and Oracle Client Installation

Dear Chandra,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the recent developments regarding our discussions on addressing the remote connection issue with the monuser account in Zabbix and Grafana.

As we discussed earlier, we have implemented a new Zabbix proxy, and the decision was made to migrate the monitoring from the old database proxy to the new one. Additionally, your team has installed the Oracle client to facilitate detailed log debugging.

During yesterday's call, we intended to proceed with debugging the logs and transitioning the monitoring to the new proxy. However, by the time we were prepared to do so, the issue had already been resolved, preventing us from conducting a thorough test.

In light of this, I have discussed with Jayanth and Hari, and we have agreed to schedule a dedicated call to delve into this matter in detail. This will allow us to review the steps taken, discuss any additional measures needed, and ensure a smooth transition to the new proxy while addressing any lingering concerns.

I will coordinate with you to finalize the call schedule and ensure that all necessary parties are involved for a comprehensive discussion.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in resolving this issue promptly.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
