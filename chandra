Subject: Issue Investigation Update - Remote Connection Problem with Monuser Account

Dear Chandra,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the issue we've been investigating regarding the remote connection problem with the monuser account in Zabbix and Grafana.

After thorough cross-verification in Zabbix, we've identified that the issue began coinciding with the start of the database activity for the servers included in the maintenance window you provided us. The problem persisted for approximately 40 minutes and was resolved once you confirmed the completion of the activity. Notably, alerts were not triggered for the servers included in the maintenance window.

This situation resembles a similar incident that occurred two months ago, where we observed a pattern of issues arising after the start of certain activities and resolving automatically after approximately 4 hours.

At this point, we suspect that the monuser account may have been impacted by some change, leading to the inability to connect remotely from tools such as Zabbix or Grafana. We will continue investigating this matter to pinpoint the exact cause and implement any necessary corrective actions.

Please let me know if you have any further insights or if there are specific steps you would like us to take moving forward.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
