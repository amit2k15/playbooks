Hi Sheryl,

The mentioned incident was initiated by Courtney to fulfill a custom monitoring requirement.After discussing this with Courtney and the team, it was determined that the development of a new module is necessary to meet this specific monitoring need.This process takes time. we communicated the necessary timelines for this task. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the incident, there was no option to pause the timer, which ultimately led to the breach of the SLA.

I will inform courtney and team and close the incident.

Thank you for your understanding.
