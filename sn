Hi All,

I hope this message finds you well. We are excited to inform you that we have established a new ServiceNow Workgroup dedicated to our team. This initiative is aimed at streamlining our incident and change request processes for improved efficiency and collaboration.

New ServiceNow Workgroups: 

Going forward, we kindly request all team members to utilize the new ServiceNow Workgroup for any incident or change request. This transition is a part of our ongoing efforts to enhance communication and ensure that our processes align seamlessly with our team's needs.


We appreciate your cooperation and commitment to adopting this positive change. If you encounter any challenges or have questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team. We are here to assist you in making this transition as smooth as possible.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
