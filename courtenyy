Subject: Update on UVSPOOL Monitoring Trigger Condition

Hi Courtney,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the UVSPOOL monitoring in Zabbix that we discussed recently.

After cross-verifying the monitoring setup, I found that the alert was configured based on the entire string, such as "Static: 0 or 1." However, as we discussed in our last conversation, we decided to change the condition to check for either 0 or 1 within the string.

Therefore, I have updated the trigger condition accordingly. The new configuration ensures that the alert triggers when the string contains either 0 or 1, as per our requirements.

Please let me know if you need any further information or if there's anything else I can assist you with.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
