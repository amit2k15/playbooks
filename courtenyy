Subject: Event Log Monitoring for Event ID 1129

Dear Rajesh,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the progress of our event log monitoring for event ID 1129 in the X server.

We have successfully tested the monitoring setup and have captured two entries for the same event. Based on our discussion, we can now create a condition to trigger an alert whenever there is an entry with event ID 1129. This will result in an email notification being sent to your group promptly.

To proceed further, could you please provide us with the list of servers for which you want us to monitor event ID 1129? This will help us ensure that the monitoring is implemented on the relevant servers efficiently.

Looking forward to your response and working together on this monitoring initiative.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
