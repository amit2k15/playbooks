Dear Abhishek,

I hope this email finds you well.

I have completed the cross-verification and found that the self-healing mechanism worked effectively for the following servers. The service downtime for these servers exceeded 3 minutes, triggering the self-healing process:

Server A
Server B
Server C
I have attached the screenshots showcasing the service downtime and the subsequent self-healing process for your review. Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are additional steps you'd like me to take.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
