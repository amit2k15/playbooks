Subject: Re: Certificate Expiry Issue

Dear [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I have had a discussion with the application team regarding the certificate expiry issue. It has been confirmed that the problem arose due to the expiration of the Salesforce certificate, which is a 3rd party vendor certificate.

As a result of this expiration, the handshake between MemberPortal and Salesforce was lost, leading to the inability to send emails. I want to clarify that while email communication failed, there was no functional impact beyond this.

We are working on renewing the certificate and ensuring that such issues are addressed promptly to avoid any further disruptions.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or assistance regarding this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
