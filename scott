Subject: Data Sync Issue Resolved

Dear Scott,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to follow up on the issue you reported regarding the gap in the graph. After cross-verifying the issue, we have identified that there was a data sync issue between the Zabbix proxy and the server. This discrepancy led to the gap in the graph that you observed.

To address this issue and avoid similar occurrences in the future, we are planning to increase the resources. This step will ensure smoother data synchronization and prevent any gaps in the graphs moving forward.

We will keep you updated on the progress and notify you once the resources have been upgraded.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

Best regards,
