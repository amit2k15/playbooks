Hi Sunil,

I hope this message finds you well.

Regarding the certificate monitoring setup, as all our certificates are managed by Venafi, we would need the Venafi Secure Group information to proceed with raising a read-only request for monitoring purposes.

Could you please provide us with the details of the Venafi Secure Group that we should use for this purpose? Once we have this information, we can proceed further with setting up the certificate monitoring as per our discussion.

Looking forward to your prompt response.
