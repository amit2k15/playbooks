Overview:

Database Operations: Zabbix requires various database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations). Granting all privileges ensures that the Zabbix application user can perform these operations seamlessly.
Configuration Changes: Zabbix may need to modify database schemas, tables, or stored procedures based on configuration changes or updates. Granting all privileges allows these changes to be executed without permission issues.
Data Collection: Zabbix collects and stores monitoring data in the MySQL database. All privileges enable the application to insert, update, and retrieve data as needed.
Monitoring User: The user associated with Zabbix in MySQL is often dedicated solely to Zabbix operations. Granting all privileges to this user ensures that Zabbix has full control over its database activities without interference from other applications or users.
Simplicity: Granting all privileges simplifies the setup process by avoiding the need to specify individual permissions. This can be especially useful during initial setup or for non-critical environments.
