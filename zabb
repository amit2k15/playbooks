Dear Mona,

I'm writing to follow up on the recent IFMS web URL alerts you might have seen on Zabbix. These alerts were triggered due to a scheduled password maintenance activity we conducted.

As part of our yearly security protocols, we perform routine password updates for various accounts. To ensure a smooth transition, we created a maintenance window during which we generated a new password for the X account used to access IFMS web URLs.

This new password was subsequently updated on Zabbix. However, there might have been a temporary delay in synchronization between the X account and Zabbix. This delay unfortunately caused the alerts to be triggered.

We understand this might have caused some concern, and we apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused. Please be assured that the situation has been resolved. The new password is now successfully synced with Zabbix, and the alerts should no longer be triggered.

If you have any further questions or require any additional information, please don't hesitate to reply to this email.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
