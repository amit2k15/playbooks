Dear Team,

Thank you all for joining the call today to discuss the monitoring enhancements for our consumer experience applications. As discussed, please find the Minutes of the Meeting (MoM) below:

Overview of Zabbix Monitoring and Features

A brief introduction to the functionalities and benefits of Zabbix.
Information on Consumer Experience Applications under Monitoring

An overview of the applications currently monitored by Zabbix.
Application-wise Zabbix Monitoring Statistics

Detailed statistics for each application, including the total number of monitors and alerts triggered in the last 90 days.
P1/P2 Incidents Triggered in the Last 90 Days

A summary of the high-priority incidents (P1/P2) for each application over the past three months.
Opportunities to Reduce P1/P2 Incidents

Identifying areas where implementing monitoring can help reduce the frequency of P1/P2 incidents, especially in blackout areas.
Based on the analysis of the P1/P2 incidents, we noticed that a significant number of alerts were triggered by firewall issues. To address this, we see a feasible opportunity to monitor network devices in Zabbix, which could help eliminate similar issues in the future.

Please review the above points and let us know if you need any additional information or if you would like to schedule individual calls for each application to discuss further details or to identify and add missing monitors in Zabbix.

Thank you once again for your participation and valuable inputs.
