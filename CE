Dear Team,

I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully tested the Windows Task Scheduler job status monitoring in Zabbix. During the Proof of Concept (PoC), Revathi intentionally put the job in a failed state, and Zabbix correctly detected the failure, sending an email notification. Additionally, Zabbix triggered a resolve notification once the job ran successfully.

Please find the screenshots of the test results below:

Let us know if any changes are required. Additionally, please provide your availability so we can plan for the production deployment of this monitoring solution.

Thank you for your cooperation and support.
