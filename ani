Subject: MOM: Follow-up on Meeting Discussions

Hi Anirudh,

I hope this email finds you well.

Following our recent meeting, here are the key points discussed:

1. **Cluster Monitoring for Orx-Zabbix Servers:**
   - As discussed with Dinesh, they don't need any cluster monitoring for the Orx-Zabbix servers. Hence, we can remove it from the ENT Zabbix config file.

2. **Fetching Line of Business:**
   - There is a way to fetch the line of business for a server by using the x parameter, similar to how you are fetching the appname into your Chef cookbook.

3. **Chef Team Call:**
   - We need to schedule a call with the Chef team to discuss the feasibility of isolating servers to prevent them from starting or changing state back to the original config every 30 minutes.

4. **Chef Team Contact Info:**
   - Please provide the contact information for the Chef team so we can arrange the meeting to discuss the above points.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Ben
