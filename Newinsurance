Hi Team,

I am writing to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the hospitalization and subsequent unfortunate passing of my mother. I appreciate the support and assistance your team has provided during this challenging time.

As we previously discussed, the total hospital bill amounted to INR 268,000. Initially, only INR 100,000 was approved by the insurance company, and I settled the outstanding balance of INR 168,324 out of my own pocket to settle the bill to facilitate the release of my mother's body from the hospital.After the settelment of the bill, an additional amount of â‚¹88,324 was again approved by the insurance company. However, to date, I have not received this approved amount either from the hospital or from the insurance company. Following our conversation with the Insurance support team, I returned to the hospital to seek reimbursement for the additional approved amount. Regrettably, my request was denied, and I have not received any response from the hospital despite my efforts.

As suggested, I have attached the updated bill, which reflects the payment I made to settle the remaining amount. I kindly request your assistance in expediting the process to ensure that I receive the approved amount at the earliest convenience.

I understand that this situation involves multiple parties, and I appreciate your support in helping me resolve this matter. If there are any additional documents or information needed from my end, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to a favorable resolution.
