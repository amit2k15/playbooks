Subject: Issue with Trigger Details and Response Code Visibility in Oneview Portal

Dear [NIC's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue we have observed in the Oneview portal for the X application. Currently, we can only see the URL and timeout value, but crucial information such as trigger details and response codes are not visible on the Oneview portal. It's worth noting that we have already configured triggers for the same in Zabbix.

Could you please investigate this issue at your earliest convenience? It is essential for us to have visibility into trigger details and response codes within the Oneview portal for effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your assistance, and please let us know if you need any further information from our end.

Best regards,
