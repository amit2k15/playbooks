Subject: Query Regarding My Insurance Policy Claim

Dear [Insurance Company's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about a recent claim made under my insurance policy, Policy Number [Your Policy Number], which includes coverage for my parents as well as a top-up plan for each of them. I recently encountered a situation where my mother was hospitalized, incurring a total bill of $268,000. However, only $100,000 was covered by the insurance, and I had to personally cover the remaining expenses.

I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a detailed explanation as to why only $100,000 was claimed from the insurance, leaving a significant portion of the hospital bill uncovered. I believe the policy should have covered a higher amount, given the coverage I have for my family and parents.

Please provide a breakdown of the claim, the reasons for the discrepancy, and any additional information that can help me understand the situation better. I want to ensure that I am receiving the full benefits of the policy and that my parents' healthcare expenses are adequately covered.

I look forward to your prompt response and clarification regarding this matter. If any further information or documentation is required from my end, please do not hesitate to inform me.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
