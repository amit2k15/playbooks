Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well.

I've completed the cross-checking process on the provided servers, and I have some findings to share with you. Upon review, I noticed that the D:/hello path exists on all three servers as expected. However, the remaining paths do not appear to be present on all three servers except for D://He and D://hg, which are specifically present on apvrd35618.

To ensure accuracy and alignment with our objectives, could you please double-check the paths and provide us with the exact paths that should be present on all servers? This will allow us to proceed effectively with our tasks.

Looking forward to your prompt response.
