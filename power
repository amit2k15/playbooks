Hi Scott,

Thank you for bringing up the issue that occurred on the 7th. After investigating, we found that it was related to the monthly patching of the Zabbix proxy.

The root cause was identified as duplicate entries created by a discovery rule, resulting in gaps in the application graphs. We are actively working on removing these duplicate servers to prevent this issue from recurring in the future.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we address and resolve this matter.

# Specify the path to the text file
$filePath = "C:\above.txt"

# Read the content of the file
$fileContent = Get-Content -Path $filePath

# Search for the line containing the specified transaction name
$line = $fileContent | Where-Object { $_ -match "$transactionName" }

# Extract the response time from the line
$responseTime = [regex]::match($line, 'Response time taken for (\S+) is (\d+\.\d+) seconds').Groups[2].Value

# Output the response time
$responseTime
