Subject: Request for Reimbursement of Remaining Amount - Policy Update

Dear [Insurance Representative's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for providing me with the update on the base policy and top-up policy for my late mother's medical expenses. Your prompt communication has been immensely helpful during this challenging time.

I want to bring to your attention that, as per the updated policy, a total of $100,000 has been deducted from the overall bill amount, and I have settled the remaining balance to facilitate the release of my mother's body from the hospital.

Upon reviewing the details of the approved amount by the insurer, I observed that an amount of $88,000 was approved but not yet reimbursed. I have personally covered this amount, and I would appreciate your guidance on the process to claim this approved sum.

Could you kindly provide me with the necessary steps and documentation required to initiate the reimbursement process for the $88,000? Your assistance in expediting this matter would be immensely appreciated as it will assist me in managing the financial aspects during this difficult period.

Thank you once again for your support and understanding. I look forward to your guidance on the reimbursement process.

Warm regards,
