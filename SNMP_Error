Hi Dan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I have thoroughly analyzed the alerts triggered from Zabbix for the monitors you mentioned. Here are my findings:

The majority of the alerts were triggered on weekends.
Upon investigation, I did not identify any issues on the Zabbix end that would have caused the alerts during this past weekend.
To ensure we address the root cause, we will put this under observation and continue to monitor the situation closely. We will wait for the next occurrence of the issue to gather more data and pinpoint the exact cause.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist with.

Best regards,
