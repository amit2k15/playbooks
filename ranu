Subject: Re: Cross Verification of Zabbix Alerts

Hi Ranu,

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I've cross-verified the alerts in Zabbix and observed that they were functioning correctly until a few hours ago. However, currently, I can see a 401 error, which seems to be the cause of the triggered alerts.

This appears to be a genuine issue. Could you please double-check from your end to ensure everything is in order? Let's work together to resolve this issue promptly.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
