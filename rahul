Dear Rahul,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to express my gratitude for promptly processing my request and delivering the replacement laptop. Today, I received the new device and successfully logged in. However, I've encountered a few issues that I would like your assistance with:

Missing Files and Folders:
I am unable to locate the folders and files that were stored on my old laptop's desktop. Could you please guide me on how to retrieve them or if there's a way to recover this data?

PyCharm Codes Missing:
The PyCharm codes, which were originally located under C:\users\anayak21\PycharmProject directory on my old laptop, seem to be missing on the replacement device. How can I recover or transfer these codes to the new laptop?

Screen Overlapping Issue:
I've noticed that there is an issue with screen display, particularly on pages with a black background. There seems to be an overlapping of screens. Any advice on how to resolve this matter would be greatly appreciated.

I am considering returning the faulty laptop either through a courier service or in person when I return to the office on January 1st. Kindly let me know the preferred procedure for returning the old laptop.
