I hope this email finds you well. Following up on our recent meeting regarding certificate monitoring, I wanted to provide you with the updates as discussed:

Discussed Items:

Alert and notification creation for Venafi certificates in Zabbix, set at 90/60/30 days prior to expiry.
Monitoring feasibility of cloud-based certificates not present in Venafi.
Action Items:

Amit has successfully shared the Grafana dashboard link (Completed).
Satya is in the process of sharing the keystore file containing all certificates present in Azure.
We are actively working on implementing these initiatives and will keep you updated on our progress.
