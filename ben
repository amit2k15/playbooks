Subject: Implementation Plan for File Systems Report Automation

Dear Ben,

I hope this email finds you well. Following our discussion, I'm writing to outline the implementation plan for automating the file systems report for Diplomat servers on both Windows and Linux platforms using Zabbix.

Phase 1: Automating Windows Report
We will initiate the automation process by focusing on generating daily reports for Windows servers. This phase involves configuring Zabbix to collect the necessary data and generate the reports seamlessly. Our team will work diligently to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated reports.

Phase 2: Automating Linux Report
Once the Windows report automation is successfully implemented, we will proceed with automating the report generation for Linux servers. This phase will involve similar steps to configure Zabbix accordingly and ensure compatibility with Linux systems. Our goal is to streamline the process and maintain consistency across platforms.

Phase 3: Integration with SharePoint and Email
In the final phase, we will integrate the automated reports into your SharePoint platform while simultaneously configuring an email notification system for easy access and dissemination of the reports. This step aims to enhance accessibility and convenience for all stakeholders involved.

Throughout the implementation process, we will keep you updated on our progress and ensure that all requirements are met according to your specifications. Your feedback and input are highly valued, and we remain committed to delivering a solution that aligns perfectly with your needs.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification regarding the implementation plan. We are excited about this project and look forward to working closely with you to achieve our objectives.

Thank you for your trust and cooperation.
