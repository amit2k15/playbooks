Dear Courtney and Debra,

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Upon cross-verifying in Zabbix, I found that the alert was triggered only once on 12th Apr at 12:04 PM due to a configuration issue with the timestamp format. The previous configuration used %d.%m.%y, resulting in a timestamp like 12.04.2024, causing a count of 0.

After receiving your email, Debra, I promptly made the necessary adjustment to the timestamp format to %m.%d.%y. As scheduled, Zabbix checked again today (04.13.2024) at 12 PM, ensuring accurate monitoring moving forward.

I can confirm that there were no multiple alerts triggered for the same issue after the configuration change.
Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or require additional information.
