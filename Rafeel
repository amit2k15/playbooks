Hi Rafeel,

I have cross-verified the alert and confirmed that we are actively monitoring the specified URL. We have configured Zabbix to trigger an alert if the expected healthy keyword is not received.

Upon reviewing the last alert triggered by Zabbix, it was observed that a Timeout error occurred at that time, indicating that the URL was down. I suspect that enabling the debug tool might be causing the URL to become unavailable.

Please review this at your end and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
